# Description
This project is a Node.js application using Express for creating a RESTful API for a blog platform. It includes middleware for parsing JSON requests and connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. The blog routes are organized under /api/v1 and include endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts. Environment variables are managed using the dotenv package, and the application listens on either the environment variable PORT or port 3000 by default. The default route (/) displays a simple HTML message. The project is structured to scale and maintain blog content efficiently, offering a robust backend solution for managing blog posts.
